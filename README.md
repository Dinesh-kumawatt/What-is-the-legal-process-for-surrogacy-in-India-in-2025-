# What-is-the-legal-process-for-surrogacy-in-India-in-2025-

As of 2025, surrogacy in India is allowed only for Indian married couples (man and woman) who are infertile and have been married for at least 5 years. It must be altruisticâ€”which means no payment allowed to the surrogate except medical costs. Also, the surrogate has to be a close relative and already a mother.

Hereâ€™s the short version of the process:

Couple gets a certificate of infertility from a doctor.

Apply for permission from the district ART and Surrogacy Board.

Provide documents proving marriage, identity, and medical reports.

Surrogate undergoes counseling and screening.

Once approved, the IVF process begins.

Clinics like Trinity IVF help you through this step-by-step. They also provide legal and medical support for both the couple and the surrogate. Since the laws are strict now, itâ€™s very important to do it only through a trusted and registered clinic.
